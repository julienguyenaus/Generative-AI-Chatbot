A low temperature reduces the variability of responses, making them more consistent and easier to trust.\n",

This value means that the model will consider only the top 70% of the most likely next words when generating a response, which helps maintain accuracy and coherence in the answers.

        "- The timeout parameter is configured at 15 seconds, ensuring that responses are generated in a reasonable time frame. This is particularly important in a user-facing application where timely responses improve the user experience. A timeout prevents the model from taking too long to generate answers, which could be frustrating for users.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The max_retries parameter is set to 3, which adds resilience to the chatbot. If an API call fails due to temporary issues such as network interruptions, the model will retry the request up to three times before giving up. This enhances the reliability of the chatbot and reduces the chances of failed responses.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Creating a Retriever:** The retriever is an object that allows us to search through a vector store (which stores embeddings of documents or text chunks) and find the most relevant documents or text based on a given query. The retriever’s job is to return a subset of documents that best match the query based on similarity of their embeddings.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Setting top_k = 5:** The variable top_k is set to 5, which defines the number of results (documents or text chunks) the retriever should return from the vector store. In this case, when you perform a search or query using the retriever, it will return the top 5 most similar documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Reason for using k: **In machine learning, k is commonly used to represent the number of nearest neighbors or results that should be returned from a search. When we perform a search in a vector database, the system compares the embedding of the query with the stored document embeddings to find the closest matches.\n",
        "\n",
        "**By specifying k = 5,** we limit the results to only the top 5 most similar embeddings. This is useful because retrieving too many results may introduce noise, while retrieving too few may omit valuable information. The choice of k balances relevance and result quantity, helping to ensure that the top 5 most relevant results are retrieved for the query, offering better performance and accuracy for tasks like question-answering or document search.\n",
        "\n",
        "**vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs={\"k\": top_k}):** This line converts the vector store into a retriever object by passing search_kwargs={\"k\": top_k}. The search_kwargs argument allows you to specify additional search parameters for the retriever—in this case, limiting the number of results to the top 5 using the k value.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why is k Important?**\n",
        "* **Efficiency**: Limiting the number of retrieved documents improves efficiency. You don't need to process or rank too many results, which could slow down response time.\n",
        "* **Relevance**: Instead of returning all possible matches, we retrieve only the top k (5 in this case) results, ensuring that the returned documents are the most relevant and not overwhelming the system with irrelevant data.\n",
        "* **Performance**: Focusing on a smaller number of high-quality matches makes it easier to integrate with downstream systems like question-answering modules, which can then provide more accurate responses without unnecessary computation.\n",
        "In short, k helps fine-tune the retrieval process, ensuring efficiency and relevance in returning a manageable number of top results."
